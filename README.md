# Measuring GenAI Models

Repository with experiments done for a course "Generative Neural Networks for the Sciences" at the University of Heidelberg.

**Authors**: Agata Kaczmarek and Mateusz StÄ…czek 

### Note:
> Some of the notebooks were executed in the Google Collab environment, so the paths to the files are set up accordingly. If you want to run the notebooks locally, you will need to adjust the paths to the files.

## Data - generated images for download

All zips with images can be downloaded from the Onedrive link below (expires on Saturday, Jun 22, 2024):

## Other files, prompts, csvs

- Folder `hypothesis_testing_csv_tables` contains CSVs with results of hypothesis testing for CNN and YOLO models for DALL-E 3, SDXL Turbo and StyleGAN 2 images.
- Folder `datasets_generated_ready_models` contains, in respective subfolders, all results such as classification results, captions, and object detection results.
- **Original prompts** are in the `original prompts` folder.

## Sample images

Check folders `sample_images` for sample images generated by the models as well as some of the images with bounding boxes.
